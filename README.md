# ProxMan
### Proxmox Management Tool Similar to VMWare vCenter/vSphere

## Why does ProxMan Exist?
ProxMan was created to solve an issue that I encountered when managing a large Proxmox estate over multiple datacentre's. The company I work for wanted to transition from VMWare ESXi to Proxmox as there hypervisor, aiming to reduce overall capex. Although Proxmox is a feature-rich hypervisor, the lack of a tool similar to vCenter/vSphere did cause initial concern. I created this project to solve this problem.

## Why not use Proxmox Clusters?
Although Proxmox Clusters are a brilliant method for clustering multiple Proxmox instances together, for our use-case we wanted to keep the instances separate so that, like vCenter/vSphere, we can remove and add Proxmox instances when we want without the risk of issues occurring.

## Current Project Status
